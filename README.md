# Week 5 Daily 4

1. Make a app with 2 activities, one is a login and one is a landing activity for the login
2. Use Facebook authentication to achieve the logging in
3. Implement firebase cloud messaging in your app.  Add a screenshot of the push notification displaying on the device.

This is how the app looks like:

| Login Screen | After login button | Second activity | Push notification from firebase |
| ------------ | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
